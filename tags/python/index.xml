      <description>Markdown, that unwieldy, undying, but still relevant writing format has been through some controversy recently. There are tons of custom implementations and extensions, with Github flavored markdown being one of the more popular dialects. GFM is a prime example of how Markdown can be enhanced with meaningful extensions - from URL auto-linking, tables, to task lists.
One of the reasons for alternate implementations is that Markdown doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an official spec.</description>

      <title>Using PJAX with Tornado</title>

      <description>I love working with Tornado. Unlike Django its lightweight, supports async operations and is pretty straightforward to start off with. Tornado&amp;rsquo;s templating system is pretty nice too, and lot less verbose than Django&amp;rsquo;s. However, things start getting messy when you have to deal with conditional template inheritance.
Why would you want that? A prime example is when you use PJAX. When you PJAXify a link, you typically would want to render only the content of that page, and not the entire layout.</description>
